### Dataset compatibility table
The following table specifies which version of the jpata/particleflow software should be used with which version of the tensorflow datasets.

| Code  | CMS dataset | CLIC dataset |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------ |
| [1.9.0](https://github.com/jpata/particleflow/releases/v1.9.0) | 2.4.0    | 2.2.0    |
| [2.0.0](https://github.com/jpata/particleflow/releases/v2.0.0) | 2.4.0    | 2.3.0    |
| [2.1.0](https://github.com/jpata/particleflow/releases/v2.1.0) | 2.5.0    | 2.5.0    |
| [2.2.0](https://github.com/jpata/particleflow/releases/v2.2.0) | 2.5.0    | 2.5.0    |

### Open datasets:
The following datasets are available to reproduce the studies. They include full Geant4 simulation and reconstruction based on the CLIC detector. We have no affiliation with the CLIC collaboration, therefore these datasets are to be used only for computational studies and come with no warranty.

- MLPF-CLIC, raw data: https://zenodo.org/records/8260741 or https://www.coe-raise.eu/od-pfr
