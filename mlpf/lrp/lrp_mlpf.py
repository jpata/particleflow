    The main trick is to realize that the ".lin_s" layers in Gravnet are irrelevant for explanations so shall be skipped
    The hack, however, is to substitute them precisely with the message_passing step

    Differences from standard LRP
        - Rscores become tensors/graphs of input features per output neuron instead of vectors
        - accomodates message passing steps by using the adjacency matrix as the weight matrix in standard LRP,
